1. get familiar with css grid
2. figure out how to generate a grid from the js file (with class name)
3. make sure you have a container div in the html file for the grid, which has a fixed size (add it to the style.css file)
4. default grid is 8x8 size


5. adjust the size/ borders/ margins of the squares
6. addeventlistener for mouseover (?) (see DOM video) for each square and write a function that changes the color of the square by changing the square's background color
7. make it possible for the user to set the square amount themselves (but default is 8x8); then remove the dault and replace it with the new grid, taking the same space (the total space of the container div) + set a limit to the size: 100

8. make it possible for the color to change
